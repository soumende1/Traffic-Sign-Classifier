# Project #2: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
## In this project, we need to design and train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, we need test our model program on new images of traffic signs.

##Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:
*Jupyter
*NumPy
*SciPy
*scikit-learn
*TensorFlow
*Matplotlib
*Pandas (Optional)

##Dataset
1.	Download the dataset. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.
2.	Clone the project and start the notebook.
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Signs
cd CarND-Traffic-Signs
jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
3.	Follow the instructions in the Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb notebook.
4.	Please find below Project writeup.
